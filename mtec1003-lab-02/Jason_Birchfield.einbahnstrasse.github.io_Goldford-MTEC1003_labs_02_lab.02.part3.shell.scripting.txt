==========


==========
We're going to be writing a shell script. First, though... let's figure out what day and time it is!
==========

==========
1. What day and time is it?

What command did you use, and what was its output?
----------
Wed Sep  6 19:52:08 EDT 2023


==========
2. Print out a calendar for this month.

What command did you use, and what was its output?
----------
bash: cal: command not found


==========
3. Go to your home directory. 
Then navigate to your mtec1003-lab-02 folder with a single command. 
Finally, verify that you're in the right place.

What 3 commands did you use to do this?
----------
$ cd ..
$ cd mtech1003-lab-02
pwd


==========
4. Create an empty file called copy_to_backup.sh. 
Verify that the file exists.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
touch copy_to_backup.sh
$ ls
copy_to_backup.sh 

Shell Script:
On the terminal's command prompt you can only run one command at a time.
A shell script on the other hand allows you to list multiple commands to be executed one after another.
When you run the shell script on the command line, then it executes everything in order contained in the script!


==========
5. What are the permissions on your copy_to_backup.sh.

What command did you use to find the permissions?
----------
$ ls -l copy_to_backup.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 three 197609 0 Sep  6 19:55 copy_to_backup.sh



==========
6. Change the permissions so that this file is executable by the user.
Verify the new permissions.

What commands did you use to do this?  What was the output?
----------

$ chmod u+x copy_to_backup.sh
$ ls -l copy_to_backup.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 three 197609 72 Sep  6 19:55 copy_to_backup.sh*



==========
7. Try executing the file!

$ ./copy_to_backup.sh

What command did you use to try to execute the file? What happens?
----------
$ ./copy_to_backup.sh

No output


==========
8. Open the file with nano

What command did you use to do this?
----------
nano copy_to_backup.sh



==========
9. In your file, write the commands to do the following

a. create a directory called backup 
b. copy all of the txt files in the current directory to the backup directory (use *.txt)
c. print out "I'm done backing up"

Don't forget the first line of your shell script! It should begin with #!/bin/bash)!

Write out the code you typed into your file below...
----------
#!/bin/bash
mkdir backup
cp *.txt backup/
echo "I'm done backing up"


==========
10. Create a directory in your home folder called test
----------
$ mkdir ~/test


==========
11. Go into that directory and create two empty files... 1.txt and 2.txt

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
$ cd ~/test
$ touch 1.txt
$ touch 2.txt


==========
12. Move the script that you created into this directory.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
$ mv ~/mtech1003-lab-02/copy_to_backup.sh ~/test

==========
13. Run your script.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
$ bash "C:\Users\three\test\copy_to_backup.sh"
'1.txt' -> 'backup/1.txt'
'2.txt' -> 'backup/2.txt'
I'm done backing up


==========
14. Verify that a backup folder was created in your test directory... with copies of the files present.

What commands did you use to do this?  Show the output.
----------
$ ls backup
1.txt  2.txt


==========
15. To finish up, using your mouse or with Terminal commands, save this file and be sure it's inside your mtec1003-lab-02 folder. (If not, move it into this folder.)

When finished, be sure to COMMIT your files to your GitHub repository for week 2 labs. Follow the instructions on the Course Website under Week #2...
